# DiaHelper: Automated Testing Tool

## Overview
DiaHelper is a web application designed to streamline the process of test automation. The main goal of the project is to provide an intuitive interface for managing test tasks, tracking issues, and generating reports. Java, Selenium, TestNG, and Maven were chosen for test automation, with Jenkins for continuous integration, Jira for task management, Postman for API testing, and TestLink for test documentation management. Challenges during development included integrating these tools and ensuring their seamless operation.
